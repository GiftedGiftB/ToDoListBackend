README for ToDoListBackend

PROJECT OVERVIEW

The To-Do List Backend is a simple yet powerful REST API built with Spring Boot and MongoDB.
It manages users and their tasks — allowing registration, login, adding tasks, marking them as completed, and deleting them.
The backend acts as the brain of the application, handling all logic and communication between the database and the frontend.

TECH STACK

* Spring Boot – Java framework for building APIs easily

* MongoDB – NoSQL database for flexible data storage

* Maven – Build and dependency management

* JUnit – Used for testing service layers

KEY INSIGHTS

* Designed with clean architecture — each layer (controller, service, repository) handles its own concern.

* DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) ensure secure and clean data flow between layers.

* Integration with MongoDB provides flexibility for future expansion (like categories, priorities, etc.).

* Easy to connect with any frontend — just call the REST endpoints.

CONCLUSION

This backend provides a solid foundation for task management apps.
It demonstrates how simple, well-structured code can power real-world applications.
You can expand it later to include features like user authentication tokens, notifications, or task deadlines.
